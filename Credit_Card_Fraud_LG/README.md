#Credit card fraud detection with logistic regression

#This projects implements a **Logistic Regression model from Scratch** to detect fradulent credit card transactions.

Dataset:

    #The dataset (creditcard.csv) is a real world fraud-detection dataset.
    #It contains **features(V1-V28), transaction amount, and fraud labels (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)**

    #Model Details
     **Custom Logistic Regression Model**
     **Trained on preprocessed data**
     **Achieved 99.91% accuracy**
     **Compared with Scikit-Learnâ€™s Logistic Regression**
     **Key Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**
